<h1>Migrate</h1>
<p>Migrate helps to move WordPress installations between domain names, for example between a development and production domain name.</p>

<p></p>At this time, the Migrate is only a script, rather than a plugin so that it can be run to correct database problems after a site has been moved.</p>
